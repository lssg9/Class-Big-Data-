#My expectations

At first , I started this course as a way to push myself to finally starting with coding, but actually, I didn't touch any of the scripts until September. 

I felt lost during the classes and basically did nothing to change it. 
But lately I felt more motivated. Even if I don't get feedback.

##Motivation 
~~ I can't~~

*In the next two weeks or 10 days I have to: 
  + Understand all the concepts and strange technical words
  + Put that in a short time practice. 
  +Eat well so my brain works well. 
    - That maybe requires more protein and water. 
  +Work the weekends and run back home
  +Write the paper for my punctuation.
